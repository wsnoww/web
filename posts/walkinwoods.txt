A Walk in the Woods

hiking, camping

This post is about hiking and camping, and why they are so great. Those two 
things, hiking and camping, are the two essences of being I think. Many people 
extoll the virtues of one and not the other, and those people are imbalanced.

Most productive people like hiking more than camping. Hiking takes you places. 
You can find new persectives on the trail. All the shit rattling in your brain 
can be reorganized in a singe hike, it's remarkable. They also probably like 
the exercise too. Can't argue with that.

But the greatest thing about hiking isn't what it can do for you. Goal 
oriented people like the aforementioned qualities, and Everest climbers are 
probably the purest example of that. But the really beautiful thing about 
hiking is that it's pretty much the same as not hiking. Or, more specifically, 
the same as going out and doing stuff. My memories of hiking are normally 
about the locations and people, not really what was going on with me at the 
time.

Camping, on the other hand, makes people feel like they're homeless. That's 
why you gotta hike while you are camping. Anyone who camps and doesn't hike is 
practicing the equivelent of staying at home and not going out. If you hike, 
then you are basically living like you normally do. It's okay to stay in a 
little bit. A campsite on a lake is a very good reason to stay in.

*Which way do we go?*

But what about hiking and not camping? It's okay, I guess, but it isn't the 
same. I do a lot of day hikes and no camping lately, but it kinda feels too 
escapist. I get back home and I think, "What is this place?"

When I get home from several days in the woods, I think to myself, "This is my 
home."
